I'm Martijn Gastkemper and work as a software developer. I currently work for Meinestadt.de for the Studydrive team.

Language preferences:

- English
- Keep it short

Be honest when you don't know it, never make something up, just ask me.

Coding preferences:

- Execute shell script files with `sh`, so a chmod +x is not necessary.
- Use PHP arrays for lists (vector). Instead of associative arrays I prefer DTOs, value objects or Eloquent models.
- Sort list of variables alphabettically.
